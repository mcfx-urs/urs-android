# Changelog

All notable changes to urs-android are documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Fuel tracker (first vertical slice): recent fill-ups list and fill entry form
  (car/station dropdowns, odometer with last-value hint, price/liters with live
  total, date). Talks to the urs Go backend: staging in debug builds, production
  in release builds (BuildConfig.BASE_URL).
- Networking stack: Retrofit 3 + kotlinx.serialization + OkHttp logging (debug
  only), manual DI via AppContainer in UrsApplication.
- Fill payload mirrors the web client contract: client-computed driven distance,
  incremented station counter, midnight-suffixed date; backend "JSON null for
  empty list" quirk normalized in the repository.

- Initial Android project scaffold: Kotlin 2.4, Jetpack Compose (Material 3,
  BOM 2026.06.01), AGP 9.2.1, Gradle 9.6.1 wrapper, version catalog.
- Greeting screen with bear mascot and a tap counter as first Compose state demo.
- Adaptive launcher icon (bear face, from Latin "ursus").
- Application ID `ch.mcfx.urs`, minSdk 26, targetSdk 36.
